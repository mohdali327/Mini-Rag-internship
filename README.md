# Mini-Rag-internship
This project is an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to analyze and query professional documents (resumes, research papers, etc.). It solves the "hallucination" problem in LLMs by grounding responses strictly in provided PDF context, providing a reliable assistant for recruiters or researchers.
